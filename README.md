# Stock-Market-Analysis
The script file (christina_pratas_assignment2.ipynb) analyses stock market data. The dataset used (stock_data_july_to_september.csv) has been cleaned and all values were validated. Essential financial metrics have been calculated, such stock's all-time High and Low price extremes, as well as crucial technical indicators (SMA, EMA, Returns, and Volatility) for every symbol in the dataset.
# Requirements
This script requires two external Python libraries, which you can install using pip:
1.	<b>NumPy</b>: For high-performance array calculations (required for technical_analysis).
2.	<b>Tabulate</b> (Optional): Highly recommended for formatting the summary report into a clean, professional-looking table.
<i>pip install numpy tabulate</i>
# Setup and Running the Script
The script is configured to use a relative file path, ensuring it can be run on any machine without path modification, provided the data file and .ipynb script are properly downloaded to your computer.

<b>1. Data File Placement</b>
Critical Step: You must place the data file, named stock_data_july_to_september.csv, in the same directory as the christina_pratas_assignment2.ipynb script.

<b>2.	Execution</b>
To run the analysis, you must execute the script within the Jupyter Notebook environment:
Launch Jupyter: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and start the Jupyter Notebook server:
Open the Notebook: In your web browser, select and open the christina_pratas_assignment2.ipynb file.
Run Cells: Execute all cells in the notebook, typically by selecting Cell > Run All. The final output will be displayed in the last executed cell.
